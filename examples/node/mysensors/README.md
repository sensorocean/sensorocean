The examples in this folder are based on the MySensors Arduino library
that handles the wireless radio link and protocol
between your home built sensors/actuators and HA controller of choice.
The sensors forms a self healing radio network with optional repeaters. Each
repeater and gateway builds a routing tables in EEPROM which keeps track of the
network topology allowing messages to be routed to nodes.

Please, refer to MySensors for more details and examples:
